abuse-SDL2
==========

Hey all, this is my first attempt at working with the Abuse source code which can be found [here](http://abuse.zoy.org/wiki/download).

My main goal is to update the game to use SDL2 since I've been working with it on the Shadowgrounds source code (my repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Draygera/shadowgrounds-SDL2) ).

<--To do: Fill out the rest of this later -->
